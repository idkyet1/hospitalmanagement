# Hospital Management System

A comprehensive, full-stack Hospital Management System designed to streamline and automate the core operations of healthcare institutions. This platform supports robust management of patients, doctors, appointments, and billing processes, leveraging Java Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.
